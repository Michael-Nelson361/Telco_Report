# Telco_Report

## Project Description:
The telecommunications enterprise Telco faces a significant challenge with customer retention. This project aims to unearth the underlying factors contributing to customer churn, employing advanced machine learning techniques to identify and predict patterns of customer attrition. The ultimate goal is to enable Telco to implement preemptive strategies to enhance customer loyalty and reduce churn, with the findings and predictive model being presented to the lead data scientist for strategic decision-making.

### Goals:
- Discover drivers of churn.
- Construct a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict churn.
- Present findings and process to lead data scientist, as well as recommendations.

## Initial Hypotheses:
- Churn is related to charges and potentially some services.

### Questions pertaining to the data:
- What is the relationship between monthly charges and churn?
- Does internet (or lack of) affect churn? 
- Do any of the internet services have a particular impact on churn?
- What contract types cause higher churn?
